This page includes a list of useful resources for pentesting, that I've found helpful in the past.  The sections are divided up using the [Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines). It will cover not only tools, but the entire scope of a pentesting engagement.

### Pre-engagement Interactions
### Intelligence Gathering
#### OSINT and passive recon
#### Active Scanning
##### [nmap](https://nmap.org/)
* Nmap is a port scanner and network discovery tool written by Fyodor.  It can be extended with scripts.

### Threat Modeling
### Vulnerability Analysis
### Exploitation
### Post Exploitation
### Reporting
